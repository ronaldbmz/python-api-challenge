# python-api-challenge

Completed the "WeatherPy" analysis by first extracting the cities names using citypy file and then used the API approach to get the weather records of all the cities. Also, as the last steps created the scatter and linear regression plots to identify the realtion between variables like Lat, Lon, Max Temp, Humidity%, Cloudines and Wind Speed.

## Following are some of the insights generated from the plots:
- The Latitude of the city increases, Temperature decreases.
- There is no direct relationship between Latitude of city and Humidity %
- There is no direct relationship between Latitude of city and Cloudiness
- We can observe that for Latitude of city between -60 t0 80 and Wind Speed is between 0 (min) to 20 (max).
- We can observe that in case of Northern as the Latitude increases Temperature decreases but in case of Southern as the Latitude increases Temperature also increases.
- We can observe that in case of both Northern and Southern as the Latitude increases there is no much significant increase or decrease in Humidity %. It shows that Humidity % is not directly dependent on Latitude.
- We can observe that in case of both Northern and Southern as the Latitude increases there is very slight increase in Cloudiness%.
- we can observe that in case of Northern as the Latitude increases there is very slight increase in Wind Speed but in case of Southern as the Latitude increases there is very slight decrease in Wind Speed.
